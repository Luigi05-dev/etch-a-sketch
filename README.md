# Etch-a-Sketch

A browser-based Etch-a-Sketch project I built for The Odin Project’s Foundations Course.  
It’s a digital sketchpad where you can draw, erase, change grid sizes, and use rainbow or darken modes.

## Features

- Dynamic grid that can be resized (up to 100x100)
- Four modes:
  - Black – normal drawing mode  
  - Rainbow – random colors every hover  
  - Darken – each pass darkens the square  
  - Eraser – removes color  
- Clear button to reset the grid
- Uses Flexbox for layout (no CSS Grid)
- Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
